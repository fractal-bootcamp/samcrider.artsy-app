// Next.js App with clerk integration

## General
- Note that docker is running, it just isn't shown in the terminal
- If a file is in the gitignore but isn't greyed out:
    1. delete and then retype a letter of the filename in the gitignore
    2. save the gitignore file, now the file should be greyed out
    3. if that doesn't work, reload the developer window
- Note that a git repo has been initialized in the root directory of your project!

## Clerk
- You need to go to the clerk website and create a new project.
- Then add the project's publishable key and secret key to the .env.local file.
